These are simple fortran programmes, just compile and run.

(i) gamma1_real.f gives gamma1
(ii) gamma2_real.f gives gamma2
(iii) gamma3_real.f gives gamma3

The inputs are in the file params.in, from top to bottom:

harmonic number (m)
observation duration (Tobs)
pulsar mass in solar mass (m1input)
companion mass in solar mass (m2input)
spin period in second (Ps)
longitude of periastron in degress (omperinput)
orbital inclination angle in degree (ideg)
eccentricity (ec)
orbital period in days (Pod)
